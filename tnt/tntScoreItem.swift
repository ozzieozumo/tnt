//  tntScoreItem.swift
//  tnt
//  Model class for a single scored event, e.g. Trampoline 1st pass.
//  Typically, each athlete will have multiple scoreItems for each meet.
//  The Scores managed object stores the scoreItems as an array of dictionaries.
//  The same representation is used in the cloud DB.
//  This class unwraps the [String: Any] dictionary into a model object.
